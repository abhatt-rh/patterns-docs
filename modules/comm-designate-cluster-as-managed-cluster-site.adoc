= Designate the new cluster as a managed cluster site

If you use the command line tools such as `clusteradm` or `cm-cli`, you must explicitly indicate that the imported cluster is part of a specific `clusterGroup`. Some examples of `clusterGroup` are `factory`, `devel`, or `prod`.

To tag the cluster as `clusterGroup=<managed-cluster-group>`, complete the following steps.
