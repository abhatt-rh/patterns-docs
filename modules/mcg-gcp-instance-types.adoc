= Google Cloud Platform (GCP) instance types

The Multicloud GitOps pattern was also deployed on GCP using the *n1-standard-8* VM size.  Below is a table of different VM sizes available for GCP.  Keep in mind that due to limited access to GCP we only used the *n1-standard-8* VM size.

The OpenShift cluster is made of 3 Control Plane and 3 Workers for the Datacenter cluster.

The OpenShift cluster is made of 3 Nodes combining Control Plane/Workers for the Edge/managed data center cluster.

The following table provides VM recommendations for different workloads.

|===
| *General purpose* | *Workload optimized* |  |  |  |

| Cost-optimized | Balanced | Scale-out optimized | Memory-optimized | Compute-optimized | Accelerator-optimized

| E2
| N2, N2D, N1
| T2D
| M2, M1
| C2
| A2

| Day-to-day computing at a lower cost
| Balanced price/performance across a wide range of VM shapes
| Best performance/cost for scale-out workloads
| Ultra high-memory workloads
| Ultra high performance for compute-intensive workloads
| Optimized for high performance computing workloads
