The Multicloud GitOps pattern was also deployed on Azure using the *Standard_D8s_v3* VM size. Below is a table of different VM sizes available for Azure. Keep in mind that due to limited access to Azure we only used the *Standard_D8s_v3* VM size.

The OpenShift cluster is made of 3 Control Plane nodes and 3 Workers for the Datacenter cluster.

The OpenShift cluster is made of 3 Control Plane nodes and 3 or more workers for each of the managed data center clusters.
