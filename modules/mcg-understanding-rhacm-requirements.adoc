= Understanding Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management requirements

By default, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) manages the `clusterGroup` applications that are deployed on all clusters. In the `value-hub.yaml` file, add a `managedClusterCgroup` for each cluster or group of clusters that you want to manage as one.

[source,yaml]
----
  managedClusterGroups:
  - name: region-one
    helmOverrides:
    - name: clusterGroup.isHubCluster
      value: false
    clusterSelector:
      matchLabels:
        clusterGroup: region-one
----

The above YAML file segment deploys the `clusterGroup` applications on managed clusters with the label `clusterGroup=region-one`. Specific subscriptions and Operators, applications and projects for that `clusterGroup` are then managed in a `value-region-one.yaml` file. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
  namespaces:
    - config-demo

  projects:
    - config-demo

  applications:
    config-demo:
      name: config-demo
      namespace: config-demo
      project: config-demo
      path: charts/all/config-demo

  #Subscriptions can be added too - multicloud-gitops at present does not require subscriptions on its managed clusters
  #subscriptions:
.  #  example-subscription
  #    name: example-operator
  #    namespace: example-namespace
  #    channel: example-channel
  #    csv: example-operator.v1.0.0
