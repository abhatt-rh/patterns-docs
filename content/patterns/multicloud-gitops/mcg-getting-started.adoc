== Deploying the Multicloud GitOps pattern

[discrete]
=== Prerequisite

* An OpenShift cluster
 ** To create an OpenShift cluster, go to the https://console.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud console].
 ** Select *OpenShift \-> Clusters \-> Create cluster*.
 ** The cluster must have a dynamic `StorageClass` to provision `PersistentVolumes`. See link:../../multicloud-gitops/mcg-cluster-sizing[sizing your cluster].
* Optional: A second OpenShift cluster for multicloud demonstration.
* The git binary and podman. For details see https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[Installing Git] and https://podman.io/getting-started/installation[Installing Podman]

The use of this pattern depends on having at least one running Red Hat
OpenShift cluster. It is desirable to have a cluster for deploying the GitOps
management hub assets and a separate cluster(s) for the managed cluster(s).

If you do not have a running Red Hat OpenShift cluster, you can start one on a
public or private cloud by using https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create[Red Hat's cloud
service].

=== Procedure

. Install the installation tooling dependencies. You will need:
+
. Fork the https://github.com/hybrid-cloud-patterns/multicloud-gitops[multicloud-gitops] repository on GitHub. It is recommended to fork because you can update your fork as part of the GitOps and DevOps processes.
. Clone the forked copy of this repository.
+
[source,terminal]
----
git clone git@github.com:your-username/multicloud-gitops.git
----

. Create a local copy of the secret values file that can safely include credentials.
+
[WARNING]
====
Do not commit this file. You do not want to push personal credentials to GitHub.
 Note that if you do not want to customize the secrets, these steps are not needed.
 The framework generates a random password for the config-demo application.
====
+
[source,terminal]
----
cp values-secret.yaml.template ~/values-secret-multicloud-gitops.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
vi ~/values-secret-multicloud-gitops.yaml
----

. Customize the deployment for your cluster.
+
[source,terminal]
----
git checkout -b my-branch
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
vi values-global.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
git add values-global.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
git commit values-global.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
git push origin my-branch
----

. You can deploy the pattern by running `./pattern.sh make install` or by using the link:/infrastructure/using-validated-pattern-operator/[validated pattern operator].

[id="deploying-the-cluster-by-using-the-pattern_sh-file-getting-started"]
== Deploying the cluster by using the pattern.sh file

To deploy the cluster by using the `pattern.sh` file, complete the following steps:

. Login to your cluster by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
 oc login
----
+
Optional: set the `KUBECONFIG` variable to the `kubeconfig` filepath:
+
[source,terminal]
----
 export KUBECONFIG=~/my-ocp-env/hub/auth/kubeconfig
----

. Deploy the pattern to your cluster.
+
[source,terminal]
----
 ./pattern.sh make install
----

. Verify that the Operators have been installed.
 .. To verify, in the OpenShift Container Platform web console, navigate to *Operators â†’ Installed Operators* page.
 .. Check that the Operator is installed in the `openshift-operators` namespace and its status is `Succeeded`.
// Get a SME review for this step 5
. Verify that all applications are synchronized. Under the project `multicloud-gitops-hub` click the URL for the `hub` gitops `server`. The Vault application is not synched.

As part of this pattern, HashiCorp Vault has been installed. Refer to the section on https://hybrid-cloud-patterns.io/secrets/vault/[Vault].

// The Next steps heading is not inline with the chapter and only points to contribution links for help and feedback or bugs

= Next steps

After the management hub is set up and works correctly, attach one or more managed clusters to the architecture (see diagrams below).
