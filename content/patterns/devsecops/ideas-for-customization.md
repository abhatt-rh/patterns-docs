# Ideas for Customization

# Why change it?

One of the major goals of the Red Hat patterns development process is to create modular, customizable demos. Maybe there is a tool in the CI/CD pipeline that you'd like to substitute for one of the tools in the pattern. Perhaps there is a tool you'd like to add to the hub.

# HOWTO add a new tool to the pipeline

1. Follow the guide on [how to extend a pattern](/contribute/extending-a-pattern/)
